- :scientist:	Hi there! I'm @pfaendler, a PhD student in Berend Snijder's lab at ETH Zurich, where I'm studying the phenotypic variability of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
- :bulb:	By perturbing iPSCs with various drugs, we are trying to understand cell-to-cell variability on the single-cell level using a combination of automated microscopy coupled to computer vision, with molecular measurements.
- ðŸŒ± I'm trying to use github to keep our research reproducible, but I'm still learning. 
- :envelope: Feel free to drop me an [email](ramonpfaendler@gmail.com)
