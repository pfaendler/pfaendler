* :lab_coat: Hi there! I'm Ramon, a PhD student in Berend Snijder's lab at ETH Zurich, where I'm studying the phenotypic variability of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
* :bulb: By perturbing iPSCs with various drugs, we are trying to understand cell-to-cell variability on the single-cell level using a combination of automated microscopy coupled to computer vision, with molecular measurements.
* 🌱 I'm trying to use github to keep our research reproducible, but I'm still learning. 
* :envelope: Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:ramonpfaendler@gmail.com)
* ⚡ Sports enthusiast, ask me about :martial_arts_uniform: and 🏒
* ☕ Coffee lover, anything drip coffee related.
